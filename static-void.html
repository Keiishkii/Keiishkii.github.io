							Static Void ~ Unity Project ~ 
						</h1>
						<p> 
							This was my first game I made for an a actual grade. Its not much but the aim was to play around with alot of Unities different features such as the animation controller and particle systems. Unfortantly since the project was made a few years ago I don't have any of it backed up on github and the final few video's which included the use of sound and adding a bit mroe polish wernt uploaded. The grade I got was based on the report I wrote which acompanied the game. This was based off of the things I had learnt in games development, which is why the project admitedly so bare. None the less it was a fun project to work on and I learnt alot.
							<br><br>
							The approaches used in the project included.
