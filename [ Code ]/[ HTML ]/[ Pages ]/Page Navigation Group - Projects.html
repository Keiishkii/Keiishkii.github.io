                                        Tne Embodied N170 was a research project in which we were researching the usability of virtual reality in the field of facial perception.
                                        Specifically, to see if we could find the appearance of ERP, N170.
                                        Using a mobile EEG system alongside the Meta Quest 2 we had participants interact with groups of both humanoid avatars and statues with the purpose of understanding if facial perception was being done in the same way as it would be in more traditional trials.

                                        My dissertation project for my final year at Bournemouth University, in which I achieved a first.
                                        This project involved the exploration a combined system of EEG, EMG and VR as a method of interaction for different types of games.
                                        The concept was the use FFNNs to process the signals received from EEG and EMG devices, specifically user motor imagery data, and then update the game logic and animate their avatars body parts based on these measurements.

                                        The applications' purpose was for managers to be able to communicate clearly with individuals across departments for the completion of jobs.
                                        Its main feature was the searching and assigning of workers of which are available and trained in the specific competencies required for a given job.

                                        This project involved the creating of a fully functioning, but basic, game engine. Within which, I had attempted to create demo's of levels from Xenoblade Chronicles and Metroid Prime.
                                        Unfortunately I did not get animation for the FBX format working and neither the implementation of a physics engine such as PhysX. However, the project did support custom script writing, skybox, PBR shaders and trigger colliders.
                                        And as a showcase of running around firing missiles and exploring the levels it worked out quite well.

                                        Tilt 'a' Ball was a project I started on in 2020, this was a solo project aimed to replicate the gameplay of the old Monkey Ball games but for an Android phone, whereas the phones gyroscope would be used as the main mode of control.
