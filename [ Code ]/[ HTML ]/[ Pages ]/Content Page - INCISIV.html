                                I started working at INCISIV in June 2020 as a game programmer on the development of their Unity based VR products.
                                Initially starting with remote work, I then quickly moved to Belfast to work in office.

                                In late 2021 I then returned to England to finish my degree, and after which, in 2022 was then given the role
                                of lead developer in anticipation of the development and release of CleanSheet for the Meta Quest 3's announcement.
                                During this I returned to working remotely from England, though took regular trips to Belfast when my presence was needed.
                                <br><br>
                                Throughout my time working at INCISIV, I had worked on a multitude of different and varying projects,
                                each having their own challenges:

                                requiring the development of a full-body VR IK;
                                integrating anti-piracy and in-app purchases, with the Meta backend;
                                implementing gameplay interactions systems and game flow logic,
                                including projectile physics, player interaction, and animation;
                                multiplayer networking;
                                asset code for custom shader materials and procedural mesh generation;
                                and many editor tools for set piece design, development and playback in game.

                                CleanSheet VR was a VR Football sports simulator and training tool for emulating the experiences of a football goalkeeper.
                                <br><br>
                                Their where four ways of playing CleanSheet: Quickfire, a game-mode of reacting and blocking quickly moving balls from portals;
                                Set Piece, in which a more realistic environment would be achieved by using large repository of motion capture animation of
                                a pre-generated scuffle between the players and opposing teams, culminating with a final shot for them to defend against;
                                Distribution, a multiplayer game where players from around the world would fight to win rounds by securing points from throwing balls
                                into regions around them; and finally Goalie Wars, another vs game where players would take turns in defending and attacking a goal
                                using catapults to launch balls towards there enemy.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Though I worked on each game mode, Set Piece and Goalie Wars were where my work bore the most influence:
                            </p>

                            <h1>Set Piece:</h1>
                            <p>
                                The way Set Piece is played it was required that each routine that appeared was pre-designed, this was done
                                inside a separate program, one I had originally developed when working on CleanSheet Pro (however, for the release of CleanSheet VR additional improvements and alterations where required).
                                This included the development of a state based fielder animation and physics system for controlling the npc-players and syncing there animations and positions
                                perfectly for inter-player and ball interactions. This system was then ported and updated for supporting playback within the released game, with the required logic
                                for adapting to player inputs and continuous playback of new routines.
                            </p>

                            <h1>Goalie Wars:</h1>
                            <p>
                                Goalie Wars was another of the game modes in which the majority of my work fell, this included the networking between players, and the interaction and physics
                                used for each of the players catapults. I also worked on the code side of the catapults animation and its visual effects, specifically the real-time procedural
                                mesh used for its trajectory.
                            </p>

                                Another large part of my work on this game was the anti-piracy and IAP logic. With the integration of Meta's SKU's allowing us to sell individual items
                                and bundles within an in-game store. The cosmetic system was designed to be easily expandable through Unity ScriptableObjects and prefabs.

                                MOViR was a VR based analytics tool used for profiling and testing the healthiness users.
                                Specifically it focused on two groups: individuals involved in clinical rehabilitation; and professional Rugby players,
                                with the goal of helping understand and spot instances of concussions.
                                <br><br>
                                The program consisted of several mini-games, where the users input was recorded in realtime and analysed to be displayed on a
                                front end dashboard. These mini-games focused on several aspects of the users abilities such as their manual dexterity, memory,
                                and cognitive motor skills
