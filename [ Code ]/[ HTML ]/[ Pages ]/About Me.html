                                My name is Charlie Lloyd-Buckingham, I have been working as a programmer in game / interactive software development since 2020. I have held the title of lead developer at INCISIV Ltd in 2022 - 2023, and have my name on two published PHD papers for my work on developing the software used in each.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My work can typically involve the creation of game mechanics, from player interactions and in-app purchases to the completion of complex systems, such as the sharing of multi-modal data across local networks during experiment / game runtime.
                                This has included working on single player and multiplayer experiences, with products released worldwide on platforms like the Meta Quest 2.
                                My experience involves: programming in C#, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python; creating, training and utilising neural networks; the creation of textures, 3D-Models and animation;
                                with a strong understanding of game mathematics; and the integration of unique input modalities within the Unity game engine, such as VR, EEG, EMG and custom electronics using the Arduino.
