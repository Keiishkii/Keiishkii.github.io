                            I began working with INCISIV, a VR based sports analytics company based in Ireland, in 2020. Since then, I have had the chance to work on over 5 projects.
                            Some of which I had developed from the ground up, and others I was brought into to continue their development.

                        <p>
                            VR Hockey was the initial project I began working on when I joined INCISIV, this project was the one that had evolved the most from once I joined to now.
                            The purpose was to create a full VR based Field Hockey experience, whereas the player would participate as a goal-keeper defending their team's goal from the enemy.
                            <br><br>
                            Initially the project involved the playback of player motions using Nav Mesh Agents running to position's along a manually designed timeline, where the player would then interact within the game as the goal-keeper via a simple setup of VR.
                            However, since then the project had expanded to using Motion Matching techniques to control the NPC avatars, with the games generated through code, and full body tracking for controlling the player avatar within VR using six 6-Dof trackers.
                            <br><br>
                            A large part of my work was also in data collection. All data that could potentially be useful in the analytics of player performance was collected.
                            This included every action the player made, as well as the positions and actions of all NPC players and the ball.

                        <p>
                            VR Cricket was the second project I developed, the aim of this project was to expand on an idea that INCISIV has previously looked into.
                            This was a VR version of batting practice for the game cricket, the player would be required to target and hit the specific areas of the court having been given specific designed bowls by a trainer.
                            <br><br>
                            This required the development of an animation alignment system for placement of the pitcher, so that the trajectory of the ball would be thrown identically each time, to a known target and length.
                            A lot of this project was also based around allowance of trainers to design and then set routines for their players.
                            As such a large portion of the work involved the creation of customised shaders for projecting images into the terrain, mesh generation for rendering custom shapes and the rendering of the balls trajectory.

                        <p>
                            Clean Sheet 2 was the first project I was brought on to work on that already existed. Clean Sheet, much like VR Hockey was a goalie training and analysis tool for Football clubs.
                            <br><br>
                            My initial work on this project involved performance optimisations and improving game features.
                            This involved processing accelerated game logic in parallel sub scenes, rewriting old classes and implementing a more advanced version of the animation alignment system used within VR Cricket for allowing
                            multiple NPC players to synchronise and interact with a moving ball.
                            <br><br>
                            Similarly, the 6-DoF full body tracking system used for Hockey was also ported and integrated, alongside this a new updated data collector was used.

                            MoVIR was the final project I worked on. MoVIR is a collection of smaller mini-game like tests, used for data collection, training or aiding in recovery for patients with injuries.
                            This project was split into two parts, the first was the play back of each game-mode, each functioning very differently and targeting different things.
                            The second was to allow for a trainers or those supervising in patient recovery, to generate new targeted stages for the game modes specific for individual users.
                            <br><br>
                            Due to the different nature of each mini-game, all required a variety of different implementation solutions. Though since the target of the project was to allow for customisable tests,
                            as well as having each be targeted to the individual via a calibration stage, while maintain a constant difficulty.
                            A large portion of each test had to be defined in a mathematically and alterable form.
                            <br><br>
                            This meant the visuals, mechanics and the difficulty of the tests would be generated in real time, based on the designers instructions.
                            This required the implementation of new mesh generators, transformations of game objects using matrices and the scaling of time and ranges for players of different body shapes.
